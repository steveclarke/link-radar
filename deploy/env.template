# Link Radar Production Deployment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your values
#
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Understanding .env vs env/*.env files
# ============================================================================
#
# This .env file contains variables that Docker Compose itself needs to
# interpret the compose.yml file (like image names, ports, host headers).
# These are NOT passed into running containers.
#
# The env/*.env files contain runtime environment variables that are passed
# into the running containers (like database credentials, API keys, Rails config).
#
# In other words:
#   - .env = Variables for Docker Compose to build/start containers
#   - env/*.env = Variables that containers use at runtime
# ============================================================================

# Backend Docker Image
# Docker Compose uses this to know which image to pull/run
# Build and push your backend image to GitHub Container Registry, then reference it here
# Example: ghcr.io/steveclarke/lr-backend:latest
BACKEND_IMAGE=ghcr.io/steveclarke/lr-backend:latest

# Backend Port (external port mapping)
# Docker Compose uses this to map host port to container port
# Set to the port you want to expose the backend on
# Can be left at 3000 or changed if you have port conflicts
BACKEND_PORT=3000
