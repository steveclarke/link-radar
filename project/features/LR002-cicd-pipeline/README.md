# LR002 - CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Automation

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Phase 2 & 3 Ready to Execute

## Overview

This feature establishes a complete CI/CD pipeline for LinkRadar that enforces code quality, automates validation, and prepares deployment trigger mechanisms - all without requiring infrastructure.

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation [DONE] ✅

**Goal:** Set up repository configuration and documentation  
**Time:** Completed  
**Status:** ✅ All 5 plans complete

**Plans:**
1. ✅ PR Template
2. ✅ Labels Setup  
3. ✅ Workflow Guide
4. ✅ Branch Protection (with ruleset JSON)
5. ✅ Actions Permissions

**Deliverables:**
- GitHub labels taxonomy created
- PR template with label checklist
- Comprehensive workflow documentation
- Branch protection ruleset configured
- Actions permissions enabled
- Automation scripts and guides

### Phase 2: CI Validation

**Goal:** Automate PR validation with status checks  
**Time:** ~13.5 hours (2 days)  
**Status:** 📋 Plans created, ready to execute

**Plans:**
1. ⏳ Conventional Commits Checker (~3h)
2. ⏳ Required Labels Checker (~3.5h)
3. ⏳ Lint Checker (~4.5h)
4. ⏳ Require Status Checks (~2.5h)

**Deliverables:**
- 3 validation workflows (commits, labels, linting)
- Configuration files for linters
- Local linting scripts
- Updated branch protection with required checks
- Documentation and troubleshooting guides

**Result:** PRs automatically validated and blocked if they don't meet standards.

### Phase 3: Deployment Triggers

**Goal:** Prove deployment triggers work using issue placeholders  
**Time:** ~6.5 hours (1 day)  
**Status:** 📋 Plans created, ready to execute

**Plans:**
1. ⏳ Staging Placeholder (~3h)
2. ⏳ Production Placeholder (~3.5h)

**Deliverables:**
- Staging deployment trigger (merge to master)
- Production deployment trigger (tag push)
- Deployment labels
- Release process documentation
- Activation checklist for real deployments

**Result:** Every merge and tag creates deployment tracking issues with full metadata.

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1:** ✅ Complete
- All foundation work done
- Branch protection active
- Actions enabled
- Documentation comprehensive

**Phase 2:** Execute in sequence
1. Create conventional commits workflow
2. Create required labels workflow
3. Create lint workflow
4. Update branch protection to require all checks
5. Test the integrated system

**Phase 3:** Execute in sequence
1. Create staging placeholder workflow
2. Test with merges
3. Create production placeholder workflow
4. Test with tags

## Time Investment

| Phase | Plans | Total Time | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | 5 plans | Completed | ✅ Done |
| Phase 2 | 4 plans | ~13.5 hours | 📋 Ready |
| Phase 3 | 2 plans | ~6.5 hours | 📋 Ready |
| **Total** | **11 plans** | **~20 hours** | **~45% Complete** |

## What Gets Built

### After Phase 1 ✅

- Labels for categorizing PRs
- PR template with checklist
- Workflow documentation
- Protected master branch
- Actions enabled

### After Phase 2

- Automated commit message validation
- Automated PR label enforcement
- Automated YAML/Markdown linting
- Status checks blocking bad merges
- Local linting tools

### After Phase 3

- Staging deployment tracking (merge events)
- Production deployment tracking (tag events)
- Release process documentation
- Deployment audit trail
- Activation path documented

## The End Result

**When all 3 phases are complete:**

✅ **Quality enforcement** - Invalid code can't be merged  
✅ **Automation** - Validation runs on every PR  
✅ **Deployment tracking** - Issues track staging/production readiness  
✅ **Documentation** - Complete guides for everything  
✅ **Activation ready** - Easy path to real deployments  
✅ **No infrastructure needed** - Works with just GitHub

## Placeholder → Real Deployment

**Current (Placeholder):**
```
Merge to master → GitHub issue created
Tag push → GitHub issue created
```

**Future (Real Deployment):**
```
Merge to master → Docker build → Push images → Deploy to staging → Update issue
Tag push → Docker build → Push images → Deploy to production → Update issue
```

**Activation:**
- Replace issue creation with deployment steps
- Same triggers, same metadata
- Issues become deployment status reports
- See `project/guides/deployment/activation-checklist.md`

## Dependencies

**None!** This feature is completely self-contained and can be completed without:
- Infrastructure (LR001)
- Staging environment
- Production environment
- Container registry
- Deployment tools

Everything works with just GitHub and git.

## Related Features

**LR001 - Core Infrastructure Setup:**
- When complete, enables real deployments
- Phase 3 placeholders convert to real automation

**Future - Docker Build Pipeline:**
- Will integrate with Phase 3 triggers
- Will build and tag images for deployment

**Future - Environment Provisioning:**
- Will create staging/production environments
- Phase 3 triggers will deploy to these

## Progress Tracking

**Phase 1:** ✅✅✅✅✅ (5/5 complete)  
**Phase 2:** ⬜⬜⬜⬜ (0/4 complete)  
**Phase 3:** ⬜⬜ (0/2 complete)

**Overall:** 5/11 plans complete (45%)

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 2 Plan 1** - Conventional Commits workflow
2. Continue through Phase 2 sequentially
3. Execute Phase 3 after Phase 2 complete
4. LR002 complete!
