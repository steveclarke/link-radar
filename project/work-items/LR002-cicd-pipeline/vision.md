# LR002 - CI/CD Pipeline & Deployment Automation

## Vision

Establish a robust, automated CI/CD workflow for the LinkRadar monorepo that enforces code quality standards, streamlines development, and prepares the foundation for safe, reproducible deployments. This work item focuses on implementing the **groundwork and validation layers** that can be done immediately, with deployment automation coming in future iterations once infrastructure is stable.

## Problem Statement

As LinkRadar grows from initial prototype to production system, we need:

1. **Code Quality Enforcement** - Ensure all code follows conventions (Conventional Commits, proper labeling) before merging
2. **Branch Protection** - Prevent direct pushes to `main` and enforce PR-based workflow with reviews
3. **Automated Validation** - Run linting and validation checks automatically on every PR
4. **Deployment Trigger Framework** - Establish workflow triggers (merge to `main`, tag push) that will eventually trigger deployments, but initially just verify the triggers work correctly
5. **Process Documentation** - Document the complete Git/GitHub workflow so team practices are consistent

## Goals

### Primary Goals (LR002)

1. **Configure GitHub Repository Rules**
   - Branch protections on `main` requiring PRs, reviews, and passing status checks
   - PR template with label requirement checklist
   - Linear history through squash merges

2. **Implement CI Validation Pipeline**
   - Conventional Commits validation (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, etc.)
   - Required PR labels enforcement (type + area labels)
   - Basic YAML and markdown linting
   - Status checks that block merges when validation fails

3. **Create Deployment Trigger Placeholders**
   - GitHub Action that triggers on merge to `main` → creates GitHub Issue as staging deployment placeholder
   - GitHub Action that triggers on tag push `v*.*.*` → creates GitHub Issue as production deployment placeholder
   - Proves workflow triggers work correctly without needing actual infrastructure

4. **Document Development Workflow**
   - Complete `docs/development-workflow.md` covering branching strategy, commit conventions, PR process, labeling, reviews, and release tagging

### Future Goals (Separate Work Items)

- Docker image builds with semantic tagging (`:sha-<gitsha>`, `:main`, `:vX.Y.Z`)
- Image digest extraction and storage for reproducibility
- Actual deployment automation to staging environment
- Production promotion workflow with digest validation
- Smoke tests and health checks post-deployment
- Rollback capabilities

## User Stories

### As a Developer

- I want all PRs to require review so that code quality is maintained
- I want automated validation to catch commit message and labeling errors early
- I want clear documentation on branching and PR conventions so I know the process
- I want the CI pipeline to prevent merges when validations fail so mistakes don't reach `main`

### As a Project Lead

- I want to see GitHub Issues created when code is merged to `main` so I know what's ready for staging
- I want to see GitHub Issues created when tags are pushed so I know what's ready for production
- I want a structured workflow that enforces quality without being burdensome
- I want deployment automation ready to activate once infrastructure stabilizes

## Success Criteria

### Must Have

- [ ] Branch protections configured on `main` branch (require PRs, reviews, status checks)
- [ ] PR template created with label requirements checklist
- [ ] Conventional Commits validation workflow running on all PRs
- [ ] Required-labels workflow enforcing type + area labels on all PRs
- [ ] Status checks blocking merges when validation fails
- [ ] Merge to `main` triggers workflow that creates GitHub Issue (staging placeholder)
- [ ] Tag push (`v*.*.*`) triggers workflow that creates GitHub Issue (production placeholder)
- [ ] Development workflow fully documented in `docs/development-workflow.md`
- [ ] All workflows tested with actual PR and merge
- [ ] Documentation added for how to activate real deployments later

### Should Have

- Code review guidelines in development workflow documentation
- Examples of good commit messages in documentation
- Label taxonomy documented (type labels + area labels)

### Nice to Have

- GitHub Actions status badges in README
- Automated changelog generation setup (for future use)
- PR size/complexity warnings

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: GitHub Repository Configuration

Start with the foundational repository rules that can be configured through GitHub UI and settings:

- Configure branch protections for `main`
- Create PR template
- Set up GitHub Actions permissions
- Create comprehensive development workflow documentation

### Phase 2: CI Validation Pipeline

Implement the automated validation workflows that run on PR open/update:

- Conventional Commits validation
- Required labels enforcement
- Basic linting (YAML, markdown)
- Configure status checks to block merges

### Phase 3: Deployment Trigger Placeholders

Prove the deployment trigger mechanisms work without actual deployments:

- Workflow triggered on merge to `main` creates staging placeholder issue
- Workflow triggered on tag push creates production placeholder issue
- Issues include all metadata that would be passed to real deployments

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope for LR002)

- Docker image building and tagging
- Container registry setup and management
- Actual deployment automation
- Environment provisioning (Terraform/Ansible)
- Smoke tests or health checks
- Rollback mechanisms
- Monitoring and alerting
- Secrets management beyond basic GitHub secrets setup

These will be addressed in future work items after core infrastructure (LR001) is stable.

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Branch protections too strict for solo development

**Mitigation:** Keep review requirements reasonable (1 reviewer). As solo developer, you can approve your own PRs or use GitHub's auto-merge with status checks only.

### Risk: CI validation too slow, blocks development flow

**Mitigation:** Keep validation workflows lightweight (just commit message format, labels, basic linting). Heavy builds come later.

### Risk: Placeholder workflows forgotten when moving to real deployments

**Mitigation:** Document activation steps clearly in each placeholder workflow. Add checklist for "flipping the switch" to real deployments.

## Timeline and Phases

This is a **single work item** (LR002) that should take approximately **1-2 days** to complete:

- **Day 1:** Repository configuration, PR template, documentation
- **Day 2:** CI validation workflows, deployment trigger placeholders, testing

## Dependencies

**None** - This work can begin immediately without waiting for LR001 infrastructure work to complete. The workflows are designed to work on an empty or minimal repository.

## Related Work Items

- **LR001 - Core Infrastructure Setup** - When Docker infrastructure is ready, follow-up work items will build on LR002's foundation
- **Future: Docker Build Pipeline** - Will extend Phase 3 placeholders to build real images
- **Future: Staging Deployment Automation** - Will replace staging placeholder with real deployment
- **Future: Production Deployment Automation** - Will replace production placeholder with real promotion
