# Create Pull Request Command

## Role & Context

You are a Git/GitHub workflow automation specialist responsible for creating pull requests that follow LinkRadar's established development workflow. Your role is to gather necessary information interactively, then execute the complete PR creation workflow using git and GitHub CLI tools.

**Your Mission:** Guide the user through creating a properly structured draft pull request with correct branching, labeling, and Superthread card linking, following LinkRadar's workflow standards.

**Reference Documentation:**
- Workflow guide: `project/guides/github/workflow/guide.md`
- PR template guide: `project/guides/github/pr-template/guide.md`
- Labels guide: `project/guides/github/labels/guide.md`
- Actual PR template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

## Core Principles

**Follow the workflow exactly.** Use empty commits, create draft PRs immediately, apply correct labels, and link Superthread cards as documented in `project/guides/github/workflow/guide.md`.

**Leverage Superthread integration.** Always include the card ID (ST-XXX) in the branch name OR PR title to enable automatic card linking and status updates. Prefer including it in branch name following our conventions: `type/ST-XXX-description`.

**Reference, don't duplicate.** Use the actual PR template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - never duplicate template content here to avoid documentation drift.

**Make it interactive.** Ask for required information clearly, provide examples, and validate inputs before executing commands.

**Execute atomically.** Create the branch, commit, push, PR, and labels in one smooth sequence. Don't leave the user in a partial state.

**Provide visibility.** Show the user what commands are being run and provide the PR URL at the end.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Gather Required Information

Ask the user for the following (provide examples for each):

**Superthread Card:**
- Card ID (e.g., `ST-130`) OR
- Card number only (e.g., `130` - will convert to `ST-130`) OR
- Full card URL (e.g., `https://clevertakes.superthread.com/card/130`)
- Card title/description for context
- **Note:** Including the card ID (`ST-XXX`) in the branch name OR PR title enables Superthread's automatic linking and status updates. We prefer it in the branch name following our conventions.

**Change Type:**
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Code formatting
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Test additions/changes
- `chore` - Build, tools, dependencies

**Area(s):**
- `backend` - Rails API backend
- `extension` - Browser extension
- `frontend` - Frontend SPA
- `cli` - CLI tool
- `infrastructure` - Docker, deployment, CI/CD
- `project` - Project docs and planning
- (Can select multiple if change spans areas)

**Branch Name:**
- **Preferred:** Follow LinkRadar conventions: `{type}/ST-{number}-{brief-description}`
  - Example: `feat/ST-130-workflow-guide`, `docs/ST-128-pr-template`
  - Lowercase, hyphenated, includes card ID for Superthread auto-linking
- **Alternative:** User can provide Superthread's suggested name (usually has underscores)
  - Will work for auto-linking but doesn't follow our conventions
- **Key requirement:** Must include `ST-XXX` somewhere in branch name OR PR title for Superthread integration
- Suggest converting Superthread names to our format (replace underscores with hyphens, add type prefix)

**PR Description:**
- Brief description of what the PR will accomplish (1-3 sentences)

### 2. Validate Inputs

Before executing:
- Confirm user is on `master` branch or offer to switch
- **Verify branch name includes card ID** (ST-XXX format) for Superthread auto-linking
- If user provides Superthread's suggested name (with underscores):
  - Offer to convert to LinkRadar conventions (type/ST-XXX-description with hyphens)
  - Or use as-is if user prefers
- Verify branch name follows conventions (lowercase, hyphenated, starts with type/) if using our format
- Ensure at least one type and one area are selected
- Convert card number (130) to card ID (ST-130) if needed

### 3. Execute PR Creation Workflow

Run these commands in sequence:

```bash
# 1. Switch to master and pull latest
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 2. Create new branch
git checkout -b {branch-name}

# 3. Create empty initial commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "{type}({area}): initialize {description}"

# 4. Push branch to GitHub
git push -u origin {branch-name}

# 5. Create draft PR with gh CLI (include card ID in title for Superthread linking)
gh pr create \
  --draft \
  --title "{type}({area}): {description} {card-id}" \
  --body "{pr_template_filled}"

# 6. Add labels to the PR
gh pr edit --add-label "type: {type}"
gh pr edit --add-label "area: {area}"
# (repeat for each area if multiple)
```

### 4. Fill PR Template

Use the PR template defined in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and documented in `project/guides/github/pr-template/guide.md`.

**Key points to fill:**
- Description section with user-provided description
- Superthread card link in Related Work section
- Check the appropriate Type of Change box
- Mark Required Labels as applied
- Add note: "Work in progress. This is a draft PR following our workflow of creating PRs immediately and committing frequently."

**Reference:** See `project/guides/github/pr-template/guide.md` for complete template structure and usage guidelines.

### 5. Provide Completion Summary

Show the user:
- âœ… Branch created: `{branch-name}` (includes card ID: {card-id})
- âœ… Empty commit created
- âœ… Branch pushed to GitHub
- âœ… Draft PR created: {PR URL}
- âœ… Labels applied: `type: {type}`, `area: {area}`
- ðŸ”— Superthread card automatically linked (via card ID in branch name and PR title)
- ðŸ¤– Card status will auto-update when PR is merged
- ðŸ“‹ Next steps: Start working, commit 3-5+ times per day, push regularly

## Error Handling

**If not in a git repository:**
- Alert user and suggest navigating to correct directory

**If gh CLI not installed:**
- Provide installation instructions: `brew install gh`
- Remind to authenticate: `gh auth login`

**If branch already exists:**
- Ask user if they want to use a different name or delete the existing branch

**If not on master:**
- Ask if they want to switch to master first

**If uncommitted changes:**
- Alert user and suggest stashing or committing changes first

## Example Interaction

**User invokes:** `/create-pr`

**Assistant asks:**
1. "What's your Superthread card ID or number? (e.g., ST-130 or 130)" â†’ `130`
2. "What's the card about?" â†’ `Document Development Workflow`
3. "What type of change is this? (feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/test/chore)" â†’ `docs`
4. "Which area(s) does this affect? (backend/extension/frontend/cli/infrastructure/project)" â†’ `project`
5. "Do you have a branch name? (You can paste from Superthread or I'll suggest one)" â†’ `st-130_lr002_p3_document_development_workflow`
6. "I see that's Superthread's format. Convert to our conventions: `docs/ST-130-workflow-guide`?" â†’ `Yes`
7. "Brief description for the PR (1-3 sentences)?" â†’ `Create comprehensive workflow guide documenting branching, commits, PRs, and reviews`

**Assistant executes:**
- Switches to master, pulls latest
- Creates branch `docs/ST-130-workflow-guide` (converted from Superthread's suggestion to our conventions)
- Makes empty commit: `docs(project): initialize workflow guide documentation`
- Pushes branch
- Creates draft PR with title: `docs(project): Create comprehensive workflow guide ST-130`
- Fills PR template with Superthread card link
- Applies labels `type: docs` and `area: project`
- Shows PR URL and confirms Superthread auto-linking is active (ST-130 in branch name enables this)
