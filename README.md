# LinkRadar

**A personal knowledge radar that captures interesting content effortlessly and surfaces emerging trends in your learning and interests over time.**

## Overview

LinkRadar is a personal knowledge repository designed for voracious readers, researchers, and continuous learners who want to capture interesting content quickly and discover patterns in their interests over time.

Unlike traditional bookmark managers that simply save links, LinkRadar acts as your personal "radar" â€” intelligently visualizing trends, momentum, and patterns in the content you save, helping you identify emerging technologies and topics worth your attention.

## The Problem

Voracious readers and researchers face three fundamental challenges:

1. **Lost Knowledge** - You know you saved that Biome article six months ago, but where? Hours wasted re-searching or giving up entirely.

2. **Scattered Silos** - Links spread across Notion, Obsidian, Raindrop, Todoist, and email-to-self with no single place to search.

3. **Invisible Trends** - You can't see that you've saved five Biome-related articles over three months. Is this tool heating up? Should you invest time learning it now? No way to know.

## The Solution

LinkRadar makes capturing effortless and intelligence automatic:

- **Capture anywhere** - Browser extension, CLI tool, or web UI. Drop a link in under 5 seconds.
- **Archive automatically** - System saves page content so links never die on you.
- **Tag intelligently** - LLM analyzes content and suggests relevant tags automatically.
- **Search powerfully** - Full-text search across everything you've saved.
- **Organize optionally** - Accept, reject, or refine LLM suggestions, or run in full auto mode.
- **Spot trends** _(coming soon)_ - Visualize what topics are heating up in your learning.

## Core Philosophy

> "Make it as easy as breathing to capture a link, but provide powerful organization for those who want it."

LinkRadar works at 100% capacity even if you never review anything. Just dump links and search later. But if you want to organize and refine, the power is there.

## Installation
